## 4.5 模型评估的文档
    速读：本文介绍了基本的模型评估所涉及的文档，这也是我们模型从业者一般项目所提供的资料目录，实际上由于目前国内还没有相关的标准，这方面还是空白，所以这些可以对我们是很好的参考，这些内容很全面。

环境模型管理决策报告中，NRC 总结了模型的关键要素（NRC 2007)。该清单为模型评估结果的文档提供了一个有用的框架，在模型开发和应用阶段能够有效的依据。

1. 科学原理。模型背后的科学机理过程。
2. 计算基础。用于求解模型的数学算法和方法。
3. 假设和限制条件。在开发或应用模型的重要前提假设，同样模型应用的限制条件有哪些？
4. 同行评审。评审人应与模型的相关人员无关，但其的技术应与模型开发人员基本一致，对模型或其应用程序进行的文档化的关键评审。同业互查通过检查模型的假设、计算、外推、标准、附件等确保模型的技术是充足，且有完善的表现，恰当的文档和合格的建模过程（EPA 2006)。
5. 质量保证和质量控制（QA/QC）。管理系统的活动涉及计划，执行、文档和评估报告确保模型和其的组成要素类型能够满足全部的标准规范。
6. 数据有效和质量。监测和试验数据的有效性和质量能够用于开发模型校准参数和评估模型结果。
7. 测试案例。求解解析解或经验解的模型要确保其高度可信去确保算法和计算过程运算正确。
8. 验证模型。模型结果与监测数据对比评估模型的精确度，提高其的表现。
9. 竞品分析。模型结果与其他相似的模型进行对比。
10. 敏感性和不确定性分析。研究模型的参数或过程，评估内在机理缺失或其他潜在误差对模型造成的不确定性。
11. 模型分辨率适用性。模型过程的求解和模型结果与需求的分辨率对比分析。分辨率包括空间、时间、统计等。
12. 透明公开。对于模型参与者之外的公众或个体去理解评估过程和模型及输出的工作。

>In its Models in Environmental Regulatory Decision Making report, the NRC summarizes the key elements of a model evaluation (NRC 2007). This list provides a useful framework for documenting the results of model evaluation as the various elements are conducted during model development and application: 

>Scientific basis. The scientific theories that form the basis for models.
Computational infrastructure. The mathematical algorithms and approaches used in executing the model computations.
Assumptions and limitations. The detailing of important assumptions used in developing or applying a computational model, as well as the resulting limitations that will affect the model’s applicability.
Peer review. The documented critical review of a model or its application conducted by qualified individuals who are independent of those who performed the work, but who collectively have at least equivalent technical expertise to those who performed the original work. Peer review attempts to ensure that the model is technically adequate, competently performed, properly documented, and satisfies established quality requirements through the review of assumptions, calculations, extrapolations, alternate interpretations, methodology, acceptance criteria, and/or conclusions pertaining from a model or its application (modified from EPA 2006).
Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). A system of management activities involving planning, implementation, documentation, assessment, reporting, and improvement to ensure that a model and its components are of the type needed and expected for its task and that they meet all required performance standards.
Data availability and quality. The availability and quality of monitoring and laboratory data that can be used for both developing model input parameters and assessing model results.

>Test cases. Basic model runs where an analytical solution is available or an empirical solution is known with a high degree of confidence to ensure that algorithms and computational processes are implemented correctly.
Corroboration of model results with observations. Comparison of model results with data collected in the field or laboratory to assess the model’s accuracy and improve its performance. Benchmarking against other models. Comparison of model results with other similar models. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Investigation of the parameters or processes that drive model results, as well as the effects of lack of knowledge and other potential sources of error in the model. Model resolution capabilities. The level of disaggregation of processes and results in the model compared to the resolution needs from the problem statement or model application. The resolution includes the level of spatial, temporal, demographic, or other types of disaggregation. Transparency. The need for individuals and groups outside modeling activities to comprehend either the processes followed in evaluation or the essential workings of the model and its outputs.
